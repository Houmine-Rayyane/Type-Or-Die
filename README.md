 ## Note
This is my first web development project, so don't expect perfection! I'm still learning, and I'm sure there are a few bugs out there. But hey, what's a project without a little chaos, right? So feel free to let the imperfections slide, and maybe they'll make the game more interesting. Enjoy, and thanks for laughing my first attempt at web development! ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ®
